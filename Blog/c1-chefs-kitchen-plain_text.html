The psychology of Private Langauges

When I was in college I had as my guiding star this idea that everyone had a "private language" which was personal to them, kind of like their gait.  Watching Shereef's video I was reminded of this old idea, and upon rediscovering it I want to elaborate a bit on it here for this challenge.

The thing about these private languages is that they are idio-somatic (self-body, ie originating in a person's physcial form), and by my understanding represent the perfect means of communication with that person.  That is to say, if you were to "learn to speak" a person's priviate language you could acheive perfect communication with that person --it would be as good as sharing thoughts directly.  ((for those so inclined, there is an interesting rabbit hole here if you take this definition and meditate upon the idea of Love.))

Over the course of my undergraduate carrier I experimented with this idea, both trying to judge how well it integrated with other psychological theories and how other theories might be applied within it's framework.  For instance, could this inherient language be raised to the level of conscious awarness with modern theraputic techniques (CBT).  Or, could the scaffolding that takes place in a learner's mind alternately be understood as the "gramatical structuring" of an argument/dialouge as the learner works to build a pathway for the new information (Vygotsky and some Piaget).  However, while this idea of a private language was my guidaing star when I was in school, the concept wasn't MY OWN private language  --or even my idea originally.  

My personal private langauge was built around the Truth that all Everything has this force in it / running through it, which I call Light.  Some things cause the Light to scatter and become diffuse, some things cause the light to focus and intensify, and some things block the light and force it into a different direction --and the result is this massive cacophony light and shadow as all things try to work towards whatever they inheriently are.

My apologies, I tend to tell stories with very long lead-ins, but here I have finally arrived at the point.   When I watched Shereef speak, I saw a person who was cognizent of the difference between Light and Shadow.  But more than that, he is actively working to bring out the Light in others and is going about the task in a very rational way --actively using all the modern tools which are available to him.  As someone very steeped in Darkness, this sight made me Joyful on a level and to a degree I know no other way to describe.  Not even really on a personal level, although I could clearly use the assistance adjusting myself, but on a global level in that he seems to be acting as a direct counter-point to trends which have made me very nihilistic.
