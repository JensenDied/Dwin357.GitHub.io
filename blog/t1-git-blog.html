      It can be hard to understand children at the best of times, and with the high rates of recitivism of adult children to the home post-schooling, this communication divide can become even more daunting.  Hopefully, as your child is attending Dev Boot Camp, you do not need to worry about their future prospects as a basement dweller in your home --but it would still be nice to have a better understanding of what they are up to.  Towards this ends, the following has been prepared for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this early stage, your child is just learning to use the basic tools of the craft such as Git & GitHub.  Here I will give you a basic outline of how these tools function, and then will delve a little deeper into some of the benefits of doing things this way.  Now I will warn you in advance, a lot of what we are going to be talking about is some pretty high-tech computer wizardry, and I am going to be leaning on some pretty sophisticated technological metaphors in order to explaing things.
    </p>
    <p>
      First what is GitHub: imagine you are in the dorms of a college (I always liked school better than working), git"Hub" is the is the common communal area which everyone has access to. There are two key things you need to know about this common room (beyond that everyone has access to it): 1) there is a file cabinet in the room, and 2) there is a bulliton-board in the room.  If you are taking notes for the English exam, these objects are symbols which represent the services wihch GitHub provides, which are data backup and a community platform.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the bulliton-board is key because college students are like hobbits (I went to IIT) and their default condition is to lock themselves in their own individaul dorm-rooms and study.  Given this default state the bulliton board allows the students to communicate by posting messages back and forth to each other, thereby removing the need to have eye-contact or even be in the same room with the person whom you are communicating with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now before I jump into the significance of the filing cabinet, I need to ask the sometimes mystifying question, "what do college students do with their time?". Looking back in your personal history (and setting aside all the more interesting memories which might be classed "experimenting with responsibility in a pseudo-sheltered environment") you might say that 'college students study'.  And if this is your answer, you are WRONG.  College students do not study, college students spend long hours marking text books with pens and highlighters.  A task which may or may not impact their evaluation when they are called in by their professors periodically for tests  (so keep in mind during your next performance evaluation --you went to school for this).
    </p>
    <p>
      When we recognize that college students spend their time in dorm rooms marking up text books, it is obvious that there is a need for someway for the student to track the changes which they are making to the text (highlighting, underlining, et cetera).  This is where using Git commits, ie the humble post-it note, comes in.  For one thing, Post-it notes act as tabs and allow anyone to quickly flip back through previous instances of the student's work.  Additionally, by writing on the tab / post-it, it is possible to notate the changes which were being created in each instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jumping back to the common room, the role of the filing cabinet still needs to be addressed.  Now obviously a filing cabinet warehouses information (in this case textbooks) and of course college students can be messy, spilling beverages and starting small fires in their more revelrious moments, so having a remote backup site for those expensive textbooks seems like a natural idea.  However there is a little bit more than that.  See this filing cabinet also acts like a textbook-library for the students in that it allows them to check-out and return books.  Now I mentioned wizardry before, and here we start to see it shine because the filing cabinet can check-out an infinite number of copies of a book simply by handing out photo-copies of a Master Version of the book, which is always stored in the filing cabinet.  This lets people work on the same textbook/project independently and in parallel.  The other magic feature of the filing cabinet is that, when someone is returning a book which they have worked on, the filing cabinet will highlight the changes they have made to the book and thus allow a user to review these changes before commiting them to the Master copy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last bit of functionality, whereby the filing cabinet hands out photo copies and then reconciles the marked up copies back into the master is called "version control" and is a tool whereby a record is maintained so that ownership can be assigned for each adjustment to a master copy [of a textbook] to a member of the community.  On the very mundane level, is nothing just a running log which maintains a record of: 1) who, 2) made what changes, 3) when, 4) an explination of why the changes were made, and 5) how to get ahold of the person.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, and this is the big thought for the day, what this log actually does is creat a very robust delineation of attribution.  Now anyone who is a scientist or works in academia or entertainment knows the value of attribution and can appreciate efficacy of this kind of system.  But for anyone more inclined to the business persuasion, just think of "getting credit" as being synonymous with "getting money".  The difference in material comfort for an individual earning 1 million dollars vs one earning 10 million dollars is negligable.  The true motivator is the prestige and validation that is associated with the larger income, which may be done in a more resource efficient way by delineating credit directly rather than through the proxy of money.

      I hope you have found this breakdown a useful tool for understanding what exactly your child is doing down there in the basement (and where not thrown off by my referances to the sophisticated times and technologies of the 1980s).  If you do have questions please feel free to ask your children, they might get a kick out of hearing of the complexities that were photo-copiers, electric type-writers, fax-machines, and the like.  Then once the ball is rolling, it might be interesting to compare notes on Jordan Belfort and Mark Zuckerberg and marvel as the times they are a changing.
